   ✔️ **Data Types In Javascript** <br/>
   Javascript has 8 basic data types, which are categoried into “primitive & non-primitive types”. <br/>
   
  Primitive Data Types:  These are immutable & represent the most basic data types. They include:  <br/>
  1)Numbers: Represents numeric values , including integers and floating-point numbers. <br/>
  2)String: Represents sequence of characters , used for text. <br/>
  3)Boolean: Represents logical values, either  “true” or “false” .   <br/>
  4)Null: Represents the intentional absence  of any object value. It has only one value: Null. <br/>
  5)Undefined:  Represents the absence of a defined value. It has only one value: undefined. <br/>
  6)BigInt:  Represents integers of arbitrary precision, useful for numbers larger than standard Number type can handle. <br/>
  7)Symbol:  Represents a unique and immutable identifier , often used as object keys. <br/>
  
  Non-Primitive Data Types:  These are mutable and represent more complex structure. <br/>
  8)Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.  It can be used to store various data structures , including other objects, arrays and functions . Arrays and functions are technically special kind of objects in javascript.
